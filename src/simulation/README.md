# Simulation Module - Planning Document

## Overview

The simulation module is designed to provide a high-performance, scalable framework for running large-scale TicTacToe game simulations. It builds on top of the core backend module to enable efficient batch processing of millions of games.

## Design Goals

1. **Maximum Throughput**: Achieve or exceed current performance (~1.8M games/sec with FastEngine)
2. **Scalability**: Efficiently utilize multi-core processors with near-linear scaling
3. **Flexibility**: Support various simulation scenarios and configurations
4. **Low Overhead**: Minimal memory footprint even for large simulation runs
5. **Ease of Use**: Clean API that's simple to use but powerful when needed

## Architecture

### Layer 1: Core Simulation (Phase 1)
The foundation provides sequential simulation with basic configuration and result collection.

**Key Components:**
- `SimulationConfig`: Configuration for simulation runs
- `SimulationResult`: Results and statistics from completed simulations
- `Simulator`: Main simulation runner

**Use Case:** Simple batch simulations, development, testing

### Layer 2: Parallel Execution (Phase 2)
Extends core simulation with multi-threaded execution for maximum throughput.

**Key Components:**
- `ParallelConfig`: Configuration including thread management
- `ParallelSimulator`: Multi-threaded simulation runner
- Work distribution and load balancing

**Use Case:** Large-scale simulations, performance benchmarking

### Layer 3: Statistics & Analysis (Phase 3)
Comprehensive data collection and analysis capabilities.

**Key Components:**
- `Statistics`: Detailed metrics and analysis results
- `StatisticsCollector`: Trait for custom statistics collection
- Built-in collectors for common use cases

**Use Case:** Research, engine comparison, strategy analysis

### Layer 4: Advanced Features (Phase 4+)
Additional features for specialized use cases.

**Key Components:**
- Tournament system for engine matchups
- Custom board initializers
- Result streaming for memory efficiency
- Optimization strategies

**Use Case:** Tournament organization, specific scenario testing, memory-constrained environments

## Configuration Design

The module uses a builder pattern for clean, flexible configuration:

```rust
SimulationConfig::builder()
    .num_games(10_000)
    .engine(FastEngine)
    .starting_player(Player::X)
    .seed(42)  // Optional: for reproducibility
    .build()
```

For parallel simulations:

```rust
ParallelConfig::builder()
    .num_games(1_000_000)
    .engine(FastEngine)
    .num_threads(8)
    .chunk_size(1000)  // Games per work unit
    .build()
```

## Multi-threading Strategy

### Work Distribution
- Divide total games into chunks for parallel processing
- Use work-stealing queues for load balancing
- Each thread runs independent simulations

### Thread Safety
- Engines must be `Send + Sync`
- Use `Arc<dyn Engine>` for shared engine instances
- Lock-free atomic counters for statistics where possible
- Consider using channels for result collection

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize synchronization overhead
- Batch result updates to reduce contention
- Consider NUMA awareness for large systems
- Profile to identify bottlenecks

## Statistics Collection

### Basic Statistics (Low Overhead)
- Win/Loss/Draw counts
- Total games played
- Duration and throughput

### Detailed Statistics (Moderate Overhead)
- Move frequency heatmap
- Game length distribution
- Average moves per game

### Performance Statistics (Minimal Overhead)
- Games per second
- Average game duration
- Percentile analysis (p50, p95, p99)

### Custom Statistics
Implement `StatisticsCollector` trait for domain-specific metrics:

```rust
trait StatisticsCollector {
    fn on_game_start(&mut self, board: &Board);
    fn on_move_made(&mut self, board: &Board, player: Player, row: usize, col: usize);
    fn on_game_end(&mut self, result: GameResult);
    fn finalize(&self) -> Statistics;
}
```

## Memory Optimization

### Streaming Results
For extremely large simulations, stream results to:
- Files (CSV, JSON)
- Databases
- Callbacks
- Network endpoints

Avoid accumulating all results in memory.

### Result Aggregation
- Aggregate statistics incrementally
- Use fixed-size data structures
- Consider sampling for detailed analysis

### Memory Targets
- < 1KB per 1000 games for basic statistics
- < 100MB for 1M games with detailed statistics
- Streaming: O(1) memory regardless of game count

## Performance Targets

### Sequential Simulation
- **FastEngine**: ~1.8M games/sec (baseline)
- **Overhead**: < 5% vs raw loop
- **Memory**: < 100 bytes per game state

### Parallel Simulation (8 cores)
- **FastEngine**: ~12-14M games/sec (7-8x scaling)
- **Thread overhead**: < 10%
- **Load balancing efficiency**: > 95%

### With Statistics
- **Basic stats**: < 2% performance impact
- **Detailed stats**: < 10% performance impact
- **Custom collectors**: Depends on implementation

## API Design Philosophy

1. **Simple by Default**: Common cases should be trivial
2. **Powerful When Needed**: Advanced features available but not intrusive
3. **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system to prevent errors
4. **Zero Cost Abstractions**: No performance penalty for unused features
5. **Composable**: Combine features naturally

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual component functionality
- Configuration validation
- Statistics calculations

### Integration Tests
- Full simulation flows
- Multi-threaded correctness
- Statistics accuracy

### Performance Tests
- Benchmark against current examples
- Regression detection
- Scaling tests (1-16 cores)

### Stress Tests
- Millions of games
- Memory leak detection
- Long-running stability

## Migration Path

Users currently using examples can migrate gradually:

1. **Phase 1**: Drop-in replacement for simple simulations
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate to parallel execution for better performance
3. **Phase 3**: Add statistics collection for insights
4. **Phase 4**: Adopt advanced features as needed

## Open Questions

1. Should we support async/await for I/O-bound operations?
2. What's the best way to handle engine state (if any)?
3. Should we provide built-in visualization/reporting?
4. How to handle errors in parallel contexts?
5. Should we support GPU acceleration for massive simulations?

## Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Core sequential simulator - 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: Parallel execution - 1 week
- **Phase 3**: Statistics system - 1 week
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features - 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 5-8**: Polish, documentation, optimization - 2 weeks

Total estimated: 7-9 weeks for complete implementation

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this design
2. Create tracking issues for each phase
3. Implement Phase 1 (Core Simulator)
4. Benchmark and iterate
5. Proceed to Phase 2
